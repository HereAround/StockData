Analyse stock data with python3


For best practice with phyton3, create a virtual environment and run python 3 in this environment. This is to protect the python used by the system.

In ubuntu 18.04, the following command creates a virtual environment "virt-python3.7". This is a folder located in the directory where this command is being issued:

python3.7 -m venv virt-python3.7

Subsequently, activate this virtual environment by issuing

source virt-python3.7/bin/activate
